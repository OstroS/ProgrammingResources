Martin Fowler => "Architecture is the stuff that's hard to change later. And there should be as little of that stuff as possible."

"The RUP, working off the IEEE definition, defines architecture as 'the highest level concept of a system in its environment. The architecture of a software system (at a given point in time) is its organization or structure of significant components interacting through interfaces, those components being composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.'"

"A better definition would be: 'In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the design system design. This shared understanding is called "architecture." This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces.'"

rchitecture really represents the shared knowledge about the system, not anything specifically about languages, frameworks, and other technological ephemera.

"Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is."

Remember that communication is more important than technology in most software projects. If you've ever been on a failed software project, consider the reasons why it failed. Was it because of a technology reason or because of some communication problem? Most of the time, it's communication rather than technology. Technological problems have solutions. (Sometimes they are hard solutions, but they always have a solution.) Social problems are much stickier and harder to resolve. One of the famous quotes from the book Peopleware (see Resources) is:
It's always a people problem.

Remember that, as a architect, you not only have to make important decisions; you must defend them too. Sometimes the people you are talking to have their own agendas that don't make logical sense but do make sense in the crucible of corporate politics. Don't get frustrated, and remember why you made the decision in the first place.

The lean movement has a great phrase: the last responsible momentâ€” not the last moment, but the last responsible moment for decisions. The longer you can wait, the better chance you have for more suitable design.
