Martin Fowler => "Architecture is the stuff that's hard to change later. And there should be as little of that stuff as possible."

"The RUP, working off the IEEE definition, defines architecture as 'the highest level concept of a system in its environment. The architecture of a software system (at a given point in time) is its organization or structure of significant components interacting through interfaces, those components being composed of successively smaller components and interfaces.'"

"A better definition would be: 'In most successful software projects, the expert developers working on that project have a shared understanding of the design system design. This shared understanding is called "architecture." This understanding includes how the system is divided into components and how the components interact through interfaces.'"

rchitecture really represents the shared knowledge about the system, not anything specifically about languages, frameworks, and other technological ephemera.

"Architecture is about the important stuff. Whatever that is."
